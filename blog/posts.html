                <p class="lead">The new research has found that there is Water on Mars. The first spacecraft from Earth to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965. Since then, several robotic spacecraft have flown by, orbited, or landed on Mars and sent back lots of information about this world so different from our own.The first spacecraft from Earth to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965.

                    Mars is a cold, bleak wasteland, with very thin air that we Earthlings could never breathe. However, many of the pictures our telescopes, orbiters, and rovers have sent back show signs that liquid water might have been on the surface of Mars long ago. Also, we can see ice caps at the north and south poles.The first spacecraft from Earth to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965.
